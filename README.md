## Hawking Walking
This piece is the main menu screen song that plays on repeat in our SOFTENG 206 game's menu screen. The game revolves around a private investigator tasked with solving a crime, so a fitting tune was required to immerse the player into the right vibe while also fitting in with the pixel art theme.

The name comes from how I expect it to look and feel if Stephen Hawking could walk, and it's a little related since the game is about private investigation, which needs a lot of brainpower but still remains fun and playful. I had initially wanted a jazzy tune that would play during old detective films (e.g. the Pink Panther theme); but once I made the drum off-beat, a much different song resulted.

- **HawkingWalking.wav:** Proof of concept for melody, ensuring it didn't sound terrible and that my 2 teammates didn't find it terrible. Only 2 instruments (piano and drum). Used as placeholder until I had the time to improve it.
- **HawkingWalking_2.wav:** Much improved version with a saxaphone instrument layered on top of the piano, with both playing the main melody. Second drum beat fleshed out the rhythm further, and I added syncopation to the main melody that really enhanced everything. Also increased tempo.
- **HawkingWalking_3.wav:** A couple tweaks, including syncopation in final bar like the rest of the melody so that the song could repeat more smoothly. Final version for the game's OST.
